High-Performance Distributed Keyword Search System using MPI and OpenMP

Developed a High-Performance Distributed File Search System That Utilizes MPI for Inter-Node Communication and OpenMP for Intra-Node Parallelism to Efficiently Search Multiple Keywords Across Large Datasets. Implemented Dynamic Load Balancing to Optimize Workload Distribution in an HPC Environment, Reducing Search Time and Improving Efficiency.
Integrated SLURM for Job Scheduling and Performance Monitoring Tools (Grafana, Intel VTune) for SystemOptimization.
